# ⚙️ CryptoThreads-C++

A research platform written in **C++** to analyse the performance of cryptographic algorithms (AES, RSA) and text processing using multithreading. The project makes it possible to evaluate the performance of the C++ language in terms of speed, system resource utilisation and ease of implementation of cryptographic and multithreaded functions.

## 📘 Project description

Main objectives of the project:

- Testing data encryption and decryption (AES, RSA),
- Using multithreading to process large text files,
- Measurement of execution time, CPU and RAM usage,
- Evaluating the capabilities of the C++ language in the context of high-performance operations.
